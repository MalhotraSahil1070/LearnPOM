Learn Page Object model Test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver with Java, TestNG and Maven.

This is a sample project to demonstrate what is page object model framework and how it can used in selenium to automate any application. 
TestNG is used as test framework. 

I have used Data Driven approch where Data is being read from Properties file and from Excel file as well.
Two Utility classes have been created, one for reading data from properties file and second for reading data from excel file.

Extent Reports has been implemented to create the Test Report of script run.

Here is basic structure of the Framework.
- Page Objects
